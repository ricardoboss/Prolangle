## Code of Conduct

Please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct] to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Report a bug

If you find a bug, please report it by [opening a bug report issue].

## Request a feature

If you want to request a feature, please do so by [opening a feature request issue].

## Contribute a language

### Choosing a language

If you want to contribute, but are unsure about which language to pick, check unticked checkboxes at [Languages to add]
for languages we want to have.

### Requesting a specific language

To request a language that is not yet supported, please do so by looking for an [open issue for the language] and giving
it a thumbs up or [opening a language request issue] if there is none.

### Contributing code snippets

A language may also be supported in the Properties Game, but may not yet have code snippets in the Snippets Game. Check
[Snippets to add], or if you have another good code snippet to contribute for a language that has very few, do so.

### Adding a language to the Properties Game

To add a language, please do so by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with name `language/<languageName>`
3. Create a new class in the `Prolangle/Languages` folder with the name of the language you want to add
4. Extend `BaseLanguage` or implement the `ILanguage` interface
5. Add a `yield return new <languageName>()` to the `Prolangle.Services.LanguagesProvider.LanguageEnumerable` method
    - Make sure to add it in the correct order (alphabetical)
6. Commit and push your changes
7. Create a pull request against the `main` branch
8. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and be ready to make changes if necessary

### Adding a code snippet

To add a code snippet, assuming the language already exists, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with name `snippet/<languageName>`.
3. In the `Prolangle/Snippets` folder, make sure the language exists as a subfolder, or create it.
4. Create a new class inside. Follow the naming of other classes in `Snippets`: a brief description of your snippet, 
then the language name, then `Snippet`, e.g. `SimpleHaskellSnippet` for a simple case, or `DivideByZeroPhpSnippet` for
something more specific.
5. Implement `ICodeSnippet`.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Create a pull request against the `main` branch.
8. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and be ready to make changes if necessary.

## Contributing code

If you want to contribute code, first make sure there exists an issue for it. If there is none, please check the other
sections of this document to see if you should [report a bug](#report-a-bug), [request a feature](#request-a-feature) or
[contribute a language](#contribute-a-language).

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with an appropriate name
    - If you are fixing a bug, name it `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
    - If you are adding a feature, name it `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
    - If you are adding a language, name it `language/<language-name>`
    - If you are adding a code snippet, name it `snippet/<language-name>`
    - If you are doing something else, name it `<short-description>`
    - The branch name should be in `kebab-case`
3. Make your changes
4. Summarize your changes in the [`CHANGELOG.md`]
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Create a pull request against the `main` branch
7. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and be ready to make changes if necessary

## Everything else
